=============

This is a blog about mediocreHacker who wants to be a badass Hacker.

### Why 

I graduated from university with an engineer degree in 2006. I have 10 year's experience working as a programmer. I used to work in a large corparation and tiny startup, like a freelancer and a regular employee. I tried to start my own business in different countries. I can communicate in three languages and learn German now.

**However I'm still pretty mediocre.**

It is the self-help blog to achieve my goal to be a badass Hacker, **Ten-Years Success Plan**.
